# RockPaperScissorsFront

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.4.

This is an Angular project to implement the Front-end side of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

## Getting started
Welcome. This brief document is meant to guide you step by step to get the rock-paper-scissors Front-end part easily running. Please remember that in order to fully use it, you need to have it's Back-end counterpart running as well, otherwise the game will load, but it just won't work.

Lets get started!

### Get Node.js

First of all, download and install the 18.14.0 version of Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/.
If using NVM (Node Version Manager), open your Terminal of preference and type:
```shell
nvm install v18.14.0
```
Check installed Node.js versions:
```shell
nvm list
```
To switch between Node.js versions:
```shell
nvm use 18.14.0
```
Now we can use npm (Node Package Manager) to download and install all the dependencies we need.

### Download the project
Download the project's code by clicking in ***Code*** >> ***Download ZIP***

Unzip the project in the desired folder, for example: C:\Dev\rock-paper-scissors-front\

Or you can just clone the repository:
```shell
cd C:\Dev\rock-paper-scissors-front\
```
```shell
git clone https://github.com/C4rl3s/rock-paper-scissors-front.git
```


### Install dependencies
Using the Terminal, place yourself in the project's folder, and download all the npm packages:
```shell
cd C:\Dev\rock-paper-scissors-front\
npm install
```
This will check all the needed packages by looking into the ***package.json*** file, download and install them for you.

### Run the app

After every package is installed properly, it's time to run the game:
```shell
npm start
```
The game's server will be listening at port 4200, so just open you'r favourite browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/

Have fun!
